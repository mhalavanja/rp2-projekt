# Web portal for hotel management

Final project for CS Practicum 2 class where we learned PHP and JS. We also use MySQL database for storing data, simple MVC pattern and a simple ORM. Although it is not very pretty, it is very much working and some functionalities include:
- Searching hotels by city, price, rating, from and to date
- Sorting hotels by their rating and distance from city center
- Booking a room in a hotel if there is one available
- Making your profile and verifying it with an email
- Checking ratings and reviews for hotels, leaving a review and a rating for a hotel you booked a room
- Canceling your future bookings and checking your previous bookings
- Logging in as a manager of a hotel and adding/removing rooms, changing prices for a particular hotel
